        <p> Name: Critiano Ronaldo Dos Santos Aveiro Cohmm</p>
        <p> He was born on the island of madeira in Portugal on the 5th of february 1985</p>
        <p>He joined a famous club manchester united in 2005 and won 2 premier league titles and one champions league before his shocking transfer to real madrid in 2009 and the rest as everyone says it is history</p>

        <p> His ballon d or count stands at 5<p>
        <p>Though this year we are hoping that he wins the most coveted trophy in football the ballon d or for the 6th time</p>
